No problem, we love when organizations collaborate! The City Awake team will do it’s best to match your organization will another one that is also interested in collaboration. Just use the same registration form below to get started.

    <h2>The City Hall Talks</h2>

        “City Hall Talks” is a new series we’re trying out during the 2015 Festival as an inclusive platform to help shape our city’s future. In convening diverse organizations and experts in the different themes for a structured discussion and Q&A, the forums allow us to discuss and identify issues that can accelerate or hamper change within Boston, and serve as a launch pad to take action.

    <h2>Charging Admission for Your Event</h2>
    <p>
        We realize running an event has costs, in time, resources, and staff, and we absolutely do not want participation in the festival to be a burden upon any organization. With that in mind, if offering free admission to your event is not possible, we encourage organizations to consider charging a modest fee to cover operational costs, in an effort to make the festival as a whole accessible to all!
